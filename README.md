<p> Classroom Sort is a work in progress project. Designed to meet the needs of my wife, an elementary school teacher, who needs to distribute a 
large number of students into classroom sets.</p> 
<p>The students must be distributed using various criteria; some student attributes must be clustered together to allow for easier small group 
  dismissals, while others must be distributed evenly among classes in order to maintain diversity and balance. Additinally, some students 
  must not be allowed to be in the same classroom due to behavioural conflicts or familial relation. </p>
<p>Classroom Sort currently has functionality for a basic set of features, with many more coming in the near future.</p>
